Solana x402 Protocol Integration with Kora RPC
What You'll Build
This guide walks you through implementing a complete x402 (HTTP 402 Payment Required) integration with Kora, Solana gasless signing infrastructure. By the end, you'll have a working system where:

APIs can charge micropayments for access using the x402 protocol
Users pay in USDC without needing SOL for gas fees
Kora handles all transaction fees as the gasless facilitator
Payments are settled atomically on Solana blockchain
The final result will be a fully functional payment-protected API:

}
What is x402?
x402 is an open payment standard that enables seamless micropayments for API access. Instead of traditional subscription models or API keys, x402 allows servers to charge for individual API calls, creating true pay-per-use infrastructure.

Key benefits of x402:

Instant Micropayments: Pay fractions of a cent per API call
Enable AI agents to pay for API calls: Pay for API calls with AI agents
No Subscriptions: Users only pay for what they use
Web3 Payments: Transparent, verifiable payments on-chain
Standard HTTP: Works with existing web infrastructure using an HTTP 402 status code when payment is required
Servers using x402 to require micropayments for API access will return an HTTP 402 status code when payment is required. To access protected endpoints, clients must pass a valid payment to the server in a X-PAYMENT header. x402 relies on "Facilitators" to verify and settle transactions so that servers don't need to directly interact with blockchain infrastructure.

Understanding Facilitators
Facilitators are a crucial component in the x402 ecosystem. They act as specialized services that abstract blockchain payments on behalf of API servers.

What Facilitators Do:

Verify Payments: Validate that client's payment payloads are correctly formed and sufficient
Abstract Complexity: Remove the need for servers to directly interact with blockchain infrastructure (signing and paying network fees)
Settle Transactions: Submit validated transactions to Solana (or other networks)
In our demo, we create a facilitator that leverages Kora to verify and settle transactions (more details below).

What is Kora?
Kora is a Solana signer node that provides signing and gasless transaction services. It enables applications to abstract away gas fees, allowing users to pay transaction costs in tokens other than SOL, or have fees sponsored entirely.

Key features of Kora:

Gasless Transactions: Users don't need SOL to execute transactions
Fee Abstraction: Pay fees in USDC or other SPL tokens
JSON-RPC Interface: Simple HTTP API for transaction handling
Flexible Signers: Support for multiple signer backends (memory, Vault, Turnkey, Privy)
Policy Engine: Granular control over transaction validation and fee policies
In the context of x402, Kora serves as the perfect backend for facilitators: it handles network fees, it signs transactions, and it validates transactions.

Architecture Overview
Our x402 + Kora integration consists of four interconnected components with a complete request/response cycle:

Complete Payment Flow:

Client requests protected resource → API returns 402 Payment Required
Client creates payment transaction with x402 fetch wrapper (which assembles a Solana transaction with a payment instruction)
Client sends payment to Facilitator for verification
Facilitator validates via Kora, which signs and submits to Solana
Transaction confirmed on-chain, Facilitator notifies API
API returns protected content with payment receipt to Client
Component Breakdown
Kora RPC Server (Port 8080)

Core gasless transaction service
Handles transaction signing as fee payer
Validates transactions against configured policies
Facilitator Wrapper/Proxy Server (Port 3000)

Adapts Kora to x402 protocol
Implements /verify, /settle, and /supported endpoints
Translates between x402 and Kora data formats
Protected API (Port 4021)

Demo API server with payment-protected endpoints
Uses x402-express middleware for payment handling
Returns data only after successful payment
Client Application

Demonstrates x402 fetch wrapper usage
Signs transactions with user's private key
The multi-component approach might seem complex, but it mirrors real-world production systems where payment processing, API serving, and client applications are separate concerns.

Prerequisites
Before starting, ensure you have:

Rust (latest stable version)
Node.js (LTS or later)
pnpm (latest version)
Basic understanding of Solana transactions and SPL tokens
Project Setup
Step 1: Clone and Build Kora

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/solana-foundation/kora.git
cd kora

# Checkout the release branch as Kora is currently in a feature freeze for audit
git checkout release/feature-freeze-for-audit

# Build and install Kora
make install
This installs the kora binary to your system, which we'll use to run the RPC server.

Step 2: Navigate to Demo Directory

cd docs/x402/demo
Step 3: Install Dependencies
Install Node.js dependencies for all demo components:


# Install dependencies for all components (facilitator, API, and client)
pnpm run install:all
This script installs dependencies for:

The facilitator wrapper service
The protected API server
The client demonstration app
Step 4: Build Kora SDK
Build the Kora SDK so we can use the Kora TypeScript SDK in the Facilitator:


pnpm run build:kora-sdk
Step 5: Configure Environment
The demo includes a .env.example file with the required environment variables. First, let's set up the basic configuration:


# Copy the example environment file
cp .env.example .env
Now you need to generate or provide keypairs for the demo. Run the following command to generate the keypairs:


pnpm run setup
This will generate the keypairs and add them to the .env file:

KORA_SIGNER_ADDRESS - The address of the Kora signer
KORA_SIGNER_PRIVATE_KEY - The private key of the Kora signer
PAYER_ADDRESS - The address of the payer who will pay to access the protected API
PAYER_PRIVATE_KEY - The private key of the payer
Step 5: Update Configuration Files
kora.toml
The kora/kora.toml file configures the Kora RPC server. You should not need to make any changes to this file, but you can verify the following settings:

Payment Token: Ensure the Devnet USDC mint is in the allowlist:

allowed_tokens = [
    "4zMMC9srt5Ri5X14GAgXhaHii3GnPAEERYPJgZJDncDU", # USDC devnet
]
API Authentication: The demo uses an API key for Kora access. This should match the KORA_API_KEY in the .env file:

[kora.auth]
api_key = "kora_facilitator_api_key_example"
Fee Payer Policy: Configured to restrict signing unwanted transactions:

[validation.fee_payer_policy]
allow_sol_transfers = false
# all other settings are false
Allowed Programs: Ensure the system program, token program, associated token program, and compute budget program are in the allowlist:

allowed_programs = [
    "11111111111111111111111111111111",             # System Program
    "TokenkegQfeZyiNwAJbNbGKPFXCWuBvf9Ss623VQ5DA",  # Token Program
    "ATokenGPvbdGVxr1b2hvZbsiqW5xWH25efTNsLJA8knL", # Associated Token Program
    "ComputeBudget111111111111111111111111111111",  # Compute Budget Program
]
signers.toml
The kora/signers.toml file configures the Kora signer. You should not need to make any changes to this file, but you can verify the following settings:

Signer Environment Variable: Ensure the signer environment variable, private_key_env is set to KORA_SIGNER_PRIVATE_KEY (matching the env variable name in the .env file).

[[signers]]
name = "main_signer"
type = "memory"
private_key_env = "KORA_SIGNER_PRIVATE_KEY"
weight = 1
Step 6: Fund Accounts
Devnet SOL
Our Kora signer address will need SOL for paying transaction fees. You can airdrop devnet SOL to the Kora signer address using the Solana CLI:


# Airdrop SOL
solana airdrop 1 <KORA_SIGNER_ADDRESS> --url devnet
Alternatively, you can use the Solana Faucet to airdrop SOL to the Kora signer address.

Devnet USDC
Your PAYER_ADDRESS is set in the .env file will need USDC for paying transaction fees.

Get Devnet USDC from Circle's Faucet. Make sure to select "Solana Devnet" and use your PAYER_ADDRESS to request USDC.

Running the Demo
You'll need four terminal windows to run all components from the docs/x402/demo directory.

Terminal 1: Start Kora RPC Server
Run the following command to start the Kora RPC server:


pnpm run start:kora
You should see a series of logs indicating that the Kora RPC server is running, including:


INFO kora_lib::rpc_server::server: RPC server started on 0.0.0.0:8080, port 8080
Terminal 2: Start Facilitator
Run the following command to start the Facilitator:


pnpm run start:facilitator
You should see:


Server listening at http://localhost:3000
Terminal 3: Start Protected API
Run the following command to start the Protected API:


pnpm run start:api
You should see:


Server listening at http://localhost:4021
Terminal 4: Run Client Demo

pnpm run demo
Understanding the Implementation
Here's what happens during a successful payment flow:

Client Request → API returns 402 with payment requirements
Payment Creation → Client creates Solana transaction with payment
Payment Submission → Client sends request to server with payment in the X-PAYMENT header
Verification → Facilitator verifies via Kora's signTransaction
Settlement → Facilitator settles via Kora's signAndSendTransaction (sending the payment transaction to Solana)
Access Granted → Facilitator returns transaction signature and API returns protected content with payment receipt
Let's dive into how each component works:

Kora RPC (Port 8080): Handles gasless transaction signing
Facilitator (Port 3000): Bridges x402 protocol to Kora
Protected API (Port 4021): Your monetized API endpoint
Client: Demonstrates automatic payment flow
The Facilitator Wrapper/Proxy Server
The Facilitator runs on port 3000. This is the server that handles communication with Solana (in our case, via Kora). It is used to verify and settle x402 payments.

The facilitator (facilitator/src/facilitator.ts) is the bridge between x402 protocol and Kora RPC. It implements three key endpoints:

1. /verify Endpoint
This endpoint:

Receives an x402 payment payload from the Protected API server
Extracts the Solana transaction using x402 helpers
Uses Kora's signTransaction to verify validity without broadcasting
Returns verification status, isValid
2. /settle Endpoint
This endpoint:

Receives the the x402 payment payload after the payment has been verified by the /verify endpoint
Uses Kora's signAndSendTransaction to sign and broadcast the transaction
Returns the transaction signature as proof of settlement
3. /supported Endpoint
This endpoint effectively advertises the facilitator's capabilities, including:

Supported x402 version
Payment scheme (exact payments)
Network (solana-devnet)
Fee payer address which we fetch from Kora using the getPayerSigner method
The Protected API
The API server (api/src/api.ts) uses x402-express middleware to protect endpoints:


app.use(
  paymentMiddleware(
    KORA_PAYER_ADDRESS,           // Where payments should go
    {
      "GET /protected": {
        price: "$0.0001",         // Price in USD
        network: NETWORK,         // solana-devnet
      },
    },
    {
      url: FACILITATOR_URL,       // Our facilitator wrapper
    }
  ),
);
The middleware:

Intercepts requests to protected endpoints (in our case, the /protected endpoint)
Returns 402 status if payment is missing
Validates and handles payments via the facilitator
Allows access after successful payment
Though we are using Express, the x402 library includes middleware support for many common frameworks. See the x402 TypeScript Packages for more information.

The Client Application
The client (client/src/index.ts) demonstrates automatic how x402 works by sending a request with a standard fetch call and then retrying the request with the payment wrapper:


// Create a signer from private key
const payer = await createSigner(NETWORK, PAYER_PRIVATE_KEY);

// Wrap fetch with x402 payment capabilities
const fetchWithPayment = wrapFetchWithPayment(fetch, payer);

// First attempt: Regular fetch (will fail with 402)
const expect402Response = await fetch(PROTECTED_API_URL);
console.log(`Status: ${expect402Response.status}`); // 402

// Second attempt: Fetch with payment wrapper (succeeds)
const response = await fetchWithPayment(PROTECTED_API_URL);
console.log(`Status: ${response.status}`); // 200
The x402 fetch wrapper:

Detects 402 responses
Automatically creates payment transaction based on the protected API's payment requirements
Signs with user's private key
Sends payment to the facilitator for verification and processing
Retries request with payment proof in the x-payment-response header
Returns successful response
Wrapping Up
Congratulations! 🔥 You've successfully implemented a complete x402 payment flow with Kora's gasless infrastructure. This demonstration shows how:

x402 Protocol enables frictionless API monetization through micropayments
Kora RPC works as a facilitator for x402 payments by verifying and settling transactions
Users can pay for API access without holding SOL or managing gas fees
This architecture creates a powerful foundation for:

AI Agent marketplaces
Pay-per-use APIs
Micropayment content platforms
Usage-based SaaS pricing
Any service requiring instant, verifiable payments
The combination of x402 and Kora bring the power of Solana to traditional web infrastructure.
